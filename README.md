# Puzzle-Quest-Old-Icons
The icons in the remake of Puzzle Quest are pretty bad so I replaced them for the switch. Upscaled and made yellow a little brighter too. I kinda miss the pixels though I might make a more chunky one.

# Puzzle-Quest-Portraits
I batch edited all the portraits in the game with a bit of sharpness, contrast, and saturation. It helps a bit with the more blurry ones. I didn't go too crazy just wanted it to look a little better in handheld mode.
