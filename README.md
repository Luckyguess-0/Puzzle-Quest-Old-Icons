# Puzzle-Quest-Old-Icons
The icons in the remake of Puzzle Quest are pretty bad so I replaced them for the switch. Upscaled and made yellow a little brighter too.

# Puzzle-Quest-Portraits
I batch edited all the portraits in the game with a bit of sharpness, contrast, and saturation. It helps a bit with the more blurry ones. I didn't go too crazy just wanted it to look a little better in handheld mode.

# Puzzle-Cooldown-Mod
On the PsP version there was no cooldowns for spells. If you had the mana and the extra turns you could cast as you liked. The remake added some cooldown timers and while some make sense for low cost high power buffs others are annoying. I made a mod that changes any cooldown that was 1-3 to 0. Crazy buffs that cost 5-9 are still that long.
